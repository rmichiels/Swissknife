# Privacy Policy for Opportunity Tracker by Swissknife
Last updated: May 2025

Opportunity Tracker by Swissknife ("we," "our," or "the application") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data accessed via the LinkedIn API in the context of your use of our application.

## 1. Application Overview
Opportunity Tracker by Swissknife is a personal project designed to centralize and manage job opportunity data. It helps job seekers compile and organize recruiter communications received through LinkedIn, creating a unified overview of potential job leads and automating part of routine interactions.

## 2. Use of LinkedIn API
The application uses LinkedIn API scopes as necessary to access user messages and relevant sender information, which supports its core functionality. While exact API scopes are determined during development, they generally include access to recruiter messages and sender metadata such as name, position, company, and LinkedIn profile URLs.

Data collected through the LinkedIn API is stored securely in a database under the control of the user and used solely to facilitate communication management. This data is not used for any commercial purposes beyond the core functions of the application.

## 3. Purpose of Data Usage
LinkedIn data is accessed exclusively to map recruiter messages to their senders, enabling users to maintain context and follow-up efficiently. No additional personal data outside of this scope is collected or stored.

## 4. Data Sharing
Opportunity Tracker by Swissknife does not share LinkedIn-derived data with any third parties. All data remains confidential and is used solely within the application to support its intended functionality.

## 5. User Control & Consent
Users authorize data access through LinkedIn’s OAuth flow and can revoke this authorization at any time via their LinkedIn account settings.

Users maintain full ownership of the storage location where data is held and can disable LinkedIn integration or delete stored data independently at any time without intervention from Swissknife.

## 6. Data Retention
The application itself does not retain or directly store LinkedIn-derived data. Data lifecycle management—including retention, modification, and deletion—is entirely controlled by the user via their own storage instance. The application does not impose retention periods or maintain backups of user data.

## 7. Security
All data transmission between the application, LinkedIn, and user-controlled storage is encrypted using HTTPS to safeguard data in transit.

While the application does not directly store user data, it strongly encourages users to implement encryption-at-rest and follow best security practices to protect their stored data. Responsibility for securing stored data rests entirely with the user.

## 8. Jurisdiction and Regulatory Compliance
Opportunity Tracker by Swissknife is a personal initiative operated by an individual based in Belgium. Although not a formal company, the application is designed to follow privacy best practices aligned with major frameworks, including the European Union’s GDPR.

Users are encouraged to assess their own compliance responsibilities when using or deploying the application and its data.
